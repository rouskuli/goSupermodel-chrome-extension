# Gosupermodel Chrome extension

This extension slightly improves some aspects of the [gosupermodel.com](gosupermodel.com) site.

## Features

* Keyboard support for Sketzmo 
  * You can type with your keyboard instead of having to click on the letters with your mouse.
  * Works now with shared Sketzmos, too.
* ~~Batch send super greetings~~
  * Deleted, you can now trade them easily and more securely using the actual trade function.
